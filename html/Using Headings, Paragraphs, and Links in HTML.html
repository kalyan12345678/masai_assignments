    <h1> Music Recommendation System   </h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/kalyan12345678/music-recommendation">link1</a>
    <p>Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Linear Regression.
        In this project, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a song
        recommendation system. We used Million Song Dataset provided by
        Kaggle to find correlations between users and songs and to learn from the
        previous listening history of users to provide recommendations for songs
        which users would prefer to listen to most in future. Due to memory and
        processing power limitations</p>
    <h2>Cancer Disease Detection</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/kalyan12345678/cancer-detection">link2</a>
    <p>Jupyter notebook, Scikit-learn, Python, NumPy, Pandas.
        Cancer Disease Detection is about diagnosing Breast Cancer (BC) disease
        through dataset of benign & malignant disease. The early diagnosis of BC
        can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can
        promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification
        of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments.
        Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into
        malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research</p>
    <h3>Automated Hydroponic Agriculture System</h3>
    <p>C, Arduino IDE, Flutter Framework, Firebase Realtime
        Database. An automated hydroponic agriculture system uses technology
        to grow plants without soil. It circulates a nutrient-rich water solution to
        the plant roots, and includes components like a water pump, lighting,
        climate control, and automation sensors. Benefits include higher yield,
        water conservation, faster growth, space efficiency, and reduced pesticide
        use. Developing the system requires expertise in engineering, agriculture,
        automation, programming, and project management.
